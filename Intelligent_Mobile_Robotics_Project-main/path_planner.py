"""
In this file, you should implement your own path planning class or function.
Within your implementation, you may call `env.is_collide()` and `env.is_outside()`
to verify whether candidate path points collide with obstacles or exceed the
environment boundaries.

You are required to write the path planning algorithm by yourself. Copying or calling 
any existing path planning algorithms from others is strictly
prohibited. Please avoid using external packages beyond common Python libraries
such as `numpy`, `math`, or `scipy`. If you must use additional packages, you
must clearly explain the reason in your report.
